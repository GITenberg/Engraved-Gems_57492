<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>My former treatise, “Engraved Gems, their Place in
the History of Art,” being largely illustrated and
inconvenient in size, I have abridged the work and
with new material prepared this volume.</p>

<p>The various epochs of gem engraving from the
earliest eras down to the XVIII. century are briefly
described.</p>

<p>Many people throughout the year cast passing
glances at my glyptic collection in the Free Museum
of Science and Art of the University of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>They express great admiration of the beautiful
objects in stones of many colors and interesting
designs.</p>

<p>It was never intended to make only an attractive
display; what I have always desired and hoped for
was that a proportion of our visitors would recognize
in my life’s work a contribution to science.</p>

<p>It is a classified representation of the glyptic work
of more than forty centuries, so carefully arranged
that those who care to learn through the medium of
those beautiful engraved stones, cylinders, seals, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
Gnostic tokens, may inform themselves intelligently
on the science which these gems of all epochs so
thoroughly exemplify.</p>

<p>Men in this Western World during the last three
hundred years have been engrossed in the pursuit
and acquisition of fortunes.</p>

<p>A fair proportion of the population now having
secured competency, that condition once assured, with
increased opportunities for intellectual culture and
the enjoyment of art, the development of refined
tastes and pursuits in America has been marked by
the formation of many private collections. Amateurs
have gradually become connoisseurs in manuscripts,
ceramics, enamels, engravings, ancient coins, armor,
and arms. Happily, each is engrossed in his particular
branch of antiquities.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that we may all profit by their
researches, and that the antique objects acquired by
them may be stored in the Archæological Museums of
the world, that all who will may view them and learn
from them.</p>

<p>Presuming that the majority of my readers would
understand the Latin inscription from an engraved
stone, which decorates the cover of this book, I have
not given any translation. By request I add the
following explanation:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">NON SOLVM NO|BIS NATI SVMVS|ORTVSQVE NOSTRI|PARTEM<br /></span>
<span class="i0">PATRIA SI|BI VENDICAT PARTEM|PARENTES PARTEM AMICI|<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">“Not alone for ourselves were we born, and of our<br /></span>
<span class="i0">birth our country claims for itself a part, our parents<br /></span>
<span class="i0">a part, our friends a part” (vendicat for vindicat).<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On the reverse of the stone, which is not shown, is
the inscription&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">MORTIS MORES OMNIBUS ÆQUALES.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is one of those peculiar maxims so often found
in the Latin language, as it is employed in epitaphs.
The simplest manner in which it can be translated is
as follows:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="4">“The</td>
    <td>{manners}</td>
    <td rowspan="4">of Death</td>
    <td />
    <td rowspan="4">equal for all.”</td>

    <td>{law <span style="padding-left: 1.8em">}</span></td>
    <td />
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Death is here personified, as was Peace, Justice,
Concord, etc., by the Romans.</p>

ENGRAVED GEMS.</h2>

<p>When specimens of any ancient art industry are
brought together and classified in a museum it is
interesting to compare each piece and trace the work
from the hands of the different nationalities through all
the transitions and changing history of past centuries.</p>

<p>My collection exemplifies the progress in execution
of engraved gems from the most primitive eras through
periods of varying excellence and of inevitable decline.
The quality of the execution approaches perfection and
degenerates as in a geometrical progression repeating
itself in reverse; advancing and improving in fineness
up to nearly the end of the first century, the century of
Christ, and from the beginning of the second century
retrograding to the base of mediocrity at the end of the
fifth century.</p>

<p>The sixth and seventh centuries, the Byzantine period,
yielded a group of principally religious cameos, abundant,
curious, and of great interest.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<p>This was succeeded by several hundred years not of
repose in the art, but of wretched ignorance, when man
almost ceased to create a connecting link in the history
of the glyptic art. With rare exceptions, the specimens
of that time scarcely merit the designation of gems: it
was a period that may be reasonably identified as the
night of art, when, alas! in the darkness blows were
stricken which destroyed and reduced to fragments
much that was precious and beautiful, and vandalism,
contributing nothing that was fair, robbed us of a large
part of our inheritance.</p>

<p>The progression alluded to is, in my estimation, only
a question of comparative beauty. If we seek for, or
are capable of appreciating, the most interesting, that
which gives us history, we must find it at the beginning
of that progression&mdash;the era of the Babylonians&mdash;with
its messages handed down to us on their wonderful
cylinders.</p>

<p>My path of research has led me where are gathered
stones&mdash;engraved stones, art-links in a carved chain
reaching from the earliest cylinders and seals of the
Persians, centuries before and beyond those wonderful
stone books, the inscribed temples of Egypt.</p>

<p>Whilst considering and studying these specimens
of the work of the ancients we will walk upon the
crumbled ruins of by-gone centuries; our retrospective
view shall be where changing elements, rust, and age
have spared but traces of palaces and temples; we will
stroll beside the pebbled course of a rapid stream until
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
we reach a grove where I oft have been, and found a rich
repast; no shrines, no obelisks, no statues, naught but
these precious little stepping-stones, by which we will
follow the stream of thus revealed history, and in the
vale of antiquity, with these miniature monuments,
study and enjoy the indelible portraiture of ages.</p>

<p>Palaces, obelisks, statues, and the walls of ancient
cities have rarely been preserved to us, other than in
decay, ruin, and fragments.</p>

<p>Yet engraved gems, those smaller monuments on
hard stones, have been spared in the very débris of
these larger structures, and we are thus enabled to
secure examples of the handiwork of one branch of
art, covering many epochs and periods.</p>

<p>My earnest eyes have looked up to and gazed upon
the silent monuments and shrines of men, who during
long centuries have rested from their scientific labors.
A wanderer in lands adapted to my researches, my
object has been to learn something of these mute monitors
and to bring back to my native land examples of
the special branch of ancient art which has been the
pursuit of my life. Many discouraging moments, even
years, have been passed, yet always with the hope
that my labor and its results might some day be
appreciated.</p>

<p>Years ago while rejoicing in the possession of the
glyptic portraits of the Emperors Tiberius, Caracalla,
Constantine, and that of Faustina, I thought with
pleasant anticipation of the moment when on returning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
from voyages of acquisition I might introduce them to
intellectual friends of “Science and Art.”</p>

<p>These gems are here being considered in their respective
epochs. Those who desire to inform themselves on
the science of “Engraved Gems” will find in these
pages a brief view of that subject; it is in response
to many friendly demands, and shall be as concise as
reasonably possible, in keeping with ancient records on
engraved stones, cylinders, and seals. Your attention is
asked to this general view of the subject, with the hope
that it may enlist some inquirers and admirers of this
glyptic question, so little esteemed or understood in
these days; a subject not only representing a branch of
art covering a period of forty odd centuries, but a science
through whose engraved gems we have been enabled to
enrich our knowledge of the ancient history of the world.</p>

<p>Each nation which in ancient times practised the
glyptic art, produced a certain style or quality of execution.</p>

<p>After serious study of the general subject of glyptology,
one finds that the work of each epoch, and of
each nationality, bears some unmistakable trait. These
features we can almost always recognize as emanating
from a certain people.</p>

<p>So completely have we acquired an acquaintance with
the various characteristics of each nation’s handiwork in
engraving gems, that we are enabled also to discern the
epoch; not to a year, but within a century or even a
decade.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

<p>In proportion to the rudeness of the incisions we
recognize the barbaric condition of the people among
whom they were incised; also in proportion to the fineness
of the incision, beauty of conception, and execution
of the design, do we estimate the civilization of the
epoch and of the people.</p>

<p>Some of the nations who have bequeathed us engraved
gems were, in two respects, the first sculptors. They
were first, not only because none of ability had preceded
them, but rather were they first in art rank, and in excellence
of conception; their execution has never been
surpassed; their statues and high reliefs have never been
equalled in modern times.</p>

<p>Many of those colossal art works in stone have been
transported to the Vatican, to France, England, Austria,
Germany, Russia, some even to America; we are all
conversant with them. Therefore, you can readily imagine
how we define and classify the work of each
epoch and nation, when a miscellaneous mass of engraved
gems are placed before us for classification.</p>

<p>Everyone in these days is familiar with those colossal
stone figures of Rameses, Osiris, Thotmes, and others
in the sands of Egypt. Their heavy, placid countenances,
almost seeming to dream, while their inert arms
and hands hold forth the insignia of autocrats of Egypt
under the Pharaohs.</p>

<p>In Egypt, especially in the earlier or more remote
dynasties, man seems to have had the intention of handing
down to posterity the records of his power, his possessions,
and of his own appearance, on great stone
statues, obelisks, and basso-rilievos, in the most indestructible
manner.</p>

<p>Besides the colossal stone bequests created for
generations unborn, happily they produced the same
portraitures and cartouches in miniature gems. The
majority of the temple decorations in stone have
crumbled, while we can possess and enjoy the glyptic
relics which have survived the ravages of time uninjured.</p>

<p>Among the Scarabei are especially interesting examples
larger in size termed funereal; No. 1476 in my
University Collection is one of those Scarabei which
were buried with the dead, sometimes on the breast
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
underneath the wrappings, and sometimes within the
body of the mummy in the place of the heart. The
heart was embalmed separately in a vase, and placed
under the protection of the genius Duaoumautew. This
doubtlessly was done because the heart was considered
indispensable for the resurrection, yet it could not be
placed in the body until it had been upon the scales
and had passed the judgment of Osiris. When the
sentence was favorable it was promised that “his heart
shall be returned to its original cavity.” The heart, the
principle of existence and regeneration, was symbolized
by the Scarabeus. This is why texts relative to the
heart were inscribed on funereal Scarabei. On this
Scarabeus the deceased speaks, saying: “I hope that
my soul shall speedily quit or rise from the regions
infernal, and, reappearing on earth, may do all that
pleases it.”</p>

<p>Also No. 1479, a funereal Scarabeus, interesting from
the fact that the inscription contains part of the 30th
chapter of the Book of the Dead&mdash;that is, the chapter
concerning the heart: “My heart, which comes to me
from my mother&mdash;my heart, necessary to my existence
on earth&mdash;do not raise thyself against me among or
before the chief divinities.” These were the superior
gods, whom the Egyptians supposed to be in the immediate
surrounding or presence of Isis.</p>

<p>The remainder of the inscription is less legible. On
the first line is the name of Osiris Jam (all the dead had
Osiris prefixed to their names); on the last line is the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
name of his father, which is indistinct; it was evidently
the same as the name of a plant, and ending with M,
but cannot be defined; that is, it is inscribed “son
of &mdash;&mdash;,” and then the unintelligible name alluded to.</p>

<p>Also No. 1457, a funereal Scarabeus, on which the
deceased, speaking, expresses hopes, continually repeated,
that his soul may have a happy voyage, happy
relief, and transport from the inevitable transitory domain
to which all are consigned.</p>

<p>Also No. 1480, Egyptian Scarabeus, containing a vow
or wish, a vase representing a libation. The sum of the
rendering of the inscription is: “I dedicate my life to
truth, and hope for cooling breezes and libations.”</p>

<p>And No. 1461. The inscription expresses a vow or
wish: “<span class="smcap">Nefer Khet Neb</span>”&mdash;“All things good (for
thee)!”&mdash;a New Year’s wish.</p>

<p>There were artisans who engraved the larger funereal
Scarabei and kept them ready made on sale, so that in
the event of a man dying unexpectedly in youth or the
prime of life who had not thought to prepare for his
sojourn in the tomb, his family repaired to these shops,
and, choosing a Scarabeus to their taste or liking,
purchased it; the engraver then added the name of the
deceased, and they placed it under the wrappings of the
mummy.</p>

<p>These traffickers also did a thriving trade with the
living: many provided themselves in advance. There
were always a variety from which to choose; the engraver
had them for every taste. They were inscribed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
with just such vows or wishes for the future and the
repose or the enjoyment of the soul, or the commending
of the soul to the patronage and protection of some special
god or deess, as the case might demand for a man or
a woman. Often selections were given from the poetic
devotional writings of their mentors, and frequently we
meet with selections from the Book of the Dead.</p>

<p>We find shreds and examples of the costumes of the
occupants of graves of other ancient nations. These
garments were made, as now, that the body might be
decorously placed at rest. This we also find in Egypt,
the mummy-wrappings concealing and protecting the
Scarabei presenting this beautiful sentiment, indeed
unique&mdash;a symbol that was worn in life, emblematic of
its ephemeral tenure and of the ultimate resurrection
from death and the grave; a symbol that accompanied
its owner to the narrow home, not to ornament it, but as
a token of that tenant’s belief that this would be only a
brief occupancy; a symbol ready to be worn when that
tenant should enter on his resurrection into an eternal
lease of joy in a world beyond.</p>

<h2 id="PERSIA_AND_BABYLON">PERSIA AND BABYLON.</h2>

<p>We are particularly interested in the curious and
elaborately engraved cylinders and seals of the Assyrians,
Persians, the Babylonians, the Chaldeans, the
Hittites, which not only give us their costumes, but are
laden with cuneiform inscriptions. In my collection
there is a gem of the same style of work as the stone
slab in the University Museum procured by Professor
H. V. Hilprecht from the ancient palace of Ashurna
Sirbal, King of Assyria 884 to 860 <small>B. C.</small></p>

<p class="figcenter">
<img id="i_022" src="images/i_022.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This glyptic specimen is in miniature, engraved on a
rich wine-colored dark sard bearing a portrait of King
Sapor I.; he was the second of the Sassanians, who
reigned in the third century. He was crowned in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
year 242 <small>A. D.</small> It is surrounded by an inscription in
Sassanian. Sapor’s invasion of Palmyra and his contests
with the forces of Zenobia are interesting incidents
of that romantic episode in Oriental history.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_023" src="images/i_023.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PERSIAN AND SASSANIAN SEALS.</p></div>

<p>Cylinders are evidently the oldest form of seals,
though it is believed that the art originated on sections
of wooden reeds. We find Chaldean cylinders
now more than 4000 years old.</p>

<p>The signets of kings in the cylindric form were
incised in the harder and more precious materials, such
as chalcedony in several hues, the fairest those tinged
with a sapphire tint (though not the most ancient),
sards, carnelians, and occasionally beautiful red jasper;
hematite in abundance; serpentine and many softer
stones, alabaster, steatite, etc.</p>

<p>It remains a question on what materials the impressions
were made, though scientists have learned that
the figures in relief on patties of pipe-clay found so
plentifully in Babylon are the imprints of these cylinders.</p>

<p>Though a large proportion of cylinders are rudely
designed and more coarsely executed, many of them
are freely, vigorously, and well drawn, evincing a high
degree of talent.</p>

<p>Remark the anatomical drawings of man and beast;
they are unsurpassed in any age, especially the contest
between men and lions, where naturally the muscles are
strongly developed and show prominently.</p>

<p>As bearers of messages from that remote period, they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
come more welcome to us than the fairest Greek or
Roman intaglios.</p>

<p>With an interesting pictured and lettered cylinder
in hand one may have before him one of the keys to
the most ancient fountain-heads in which history is
locked up. My taste has grown and perhaps been
influenced by long association with such gems, until I
now often find more pleasure in regarding a rude fragment
of Assyrian work than I did thirty years ago
when I sought only the beautiful.</p>

<p>The place of these Babylonian cylinders in the history
of art cannot be classed as decorative, for as they were
originally used only as seals, and mostly business or
official signets, they were not at that time used to
decorate the person, though they were worn on necklaces
and bracelets by the ancient Greeks.</p>

<p>No. 499 in my collection is one of the most interesting
because the great and lamented François Lenormant
examined it with me, wrote his opinion, and expressed
his admiration of it.</p>

<p>It is a Babylonian cylinder, 29 millimetres broad by
3 millimetres in length. On it is represented a seated
god with a two-horned head-dress in a long flounced
dress; before him an altar with four spreading legs, an
antelope, a small walking figure, a scorpion, two birds
facing one another; other human figures.</p>

<p>Lenormant wrote while attending a seance of l’Institut
de France.</p>

belongs incontestably to the most antique epoch of
Chaldean art of the first years of the ancient empire.
It is at least contemporaneous with those cylinders
bearing the names of the oldest kings of d’Ous and
like those of the Dungi.”</p>

<p>Persia and Assyria furnish us also a beautiful series
of seals; the earlier conical, then a series of spherical
seals, with one side flattened, on which is the design
and inscription, and then the later Sassanian, also
spherical, yet more flattened on the sides, which are
pierced, and whose circumferences are beautifully ornamented.</p>

<p>There exist a large series of subjects adopted by their
owners on account of their superstitious belief in their
talismanic virtues; and quite a series of rudely-drawn
animals emblematic of vigilance, fidelity, courage,
strength, etc. Sometimes on seals as well as on cylinders
a full-length figure is given in whose costume
there is a marked peculiarity of drapery, the folds crossing
the form diagonally, like a Burmese Sarong.</p>

<p>They are on a great variety of chalcedonies, sards,
jaspers, and other beautiful stones of color.</p>

<p>Those of the Assyrians, dating as far back as 1110
<small>B. C.</small>, resemble in form the bells herdsmen hang upon
their grazing cattle that they may hear them when they
have strayed.</p>

<p>The location of the ancient Persians in proximity to
India, whose river-beds were rich in varieties of hard
water-worn pebbles, enabled them to procure from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
thence suitable stones for decoration and for inscriptions.
Thousands of these decorated and inscribed stones have
been unearthed and are to-day in our possession; glyptologists
can and have read them. Many examples of
these cylinders, seals, and their imprints are before you.</p>

<p>It is proven that the Assyrians knew of and practiced
the art of engraving on stone; we are not fully convinced
that they were the first to practice the art.</p>

<p>We are frequently able to corroborate glyptic inscriptions
by statements in Holy Writ, though we certainly
find on ancient cylinders, incisions many centuries
anterior to the records to which we have here alluded.</p>

<p>We know little of the Assyrian divinities through
ancient manuscripts, yet we have volumes about their
deities written on the cylinders of Babylon and Nineveh.
They were seldom in metallic mountings, but,
being pierced with holes, were strung on cords and
worn on the wrist and neck.</p>

<p>There is a host of occupants of the Assyrian heaven,
with Asshur the supreme god, Beltis Mylitta the great
mother, etc.; and on the seals in sard and chalcedony
we have sacred doves, lions, horses, etc., and a winged
bull, Nin, the god of hunting, etc.</p>

<p>These intaglio seals were often used as locks; the
doors of wine-cellars were secured by placing a seal
upon them. Cylinders have also been made by several
races of South American Indians, and are still to be
seen in Brazil.</p>

of the value of modern research among the relics of
antiquity in the fact that in 1854, Sir Henry Rawlinson,
in deciphering the inscriptions on some cylinders found
in the ruins of Um-Kir (the ancient Ur of the Chaldees),
made historical discoveries in regard to the last King of
Babylon that confirmed the truth of the book of Daniel,
and harmonized discrepancies between Holy Scripture

they present us with portraits of their monarchs, deities,

<p>The country of the ancient Etruscans was north
from the Tiber to the Ciminian Forest and the Tolfa
Mountains.</p>

<p>They have bequeathed us a mass of gems, a large
proportion in the form of Scarabei, and many really fine
intaglios, which were not only used as seals, but served
as decorations, both in finger-rings and as brooches for
women. The Etruscan tombs have yielded many Scarabei
in mountings of virgin gold, sometimes the precious
metal twisted, again corrugated; also some ornamental
gold work as brooches. The sard and chalcedony beetles
usually had an engraved beaded margin, and were
revolvable, being set on a pivot which was attached to
a frame generally oval in form.</p>

<p>The Etruscans, unlike their predecessors, have left
us few examples other than the very gems and Scarabei
by which to study their glyptic work. We have the
decorations of their sepulchral homes; we know of their
costumes by their mural paintings in those subterranean
chambers.</p>

<p>The Etruscans probably borrowed the idea of the
Scarabeus form of gem from the Egyptians; they certainly
shaped it more beautifully. They seem to have
adopted only the symbol.</p>

<p>There was a difference in the quality of their Scarabei
corresponding with the classes or stations in the life
of the people; those cut for royalty, nobility, or the
wealthy naturally received more attention in forming
and finishing.</p>

<p>Those for the tradespeople, the well-to-do, we find
quite a distinctive order. In this group they are less
graceful in shape, the beetles are rounder, thicker, and
shorter, not so carefully finished, as also the simpler
borders formed of two lines just within the edge, either
crossed with regular, straight, or oblique lines forming
bars, with some little variety of pattern.</p>

<p>The Etruscans called themselves the Rasenna; the
early Italians knew them as the Tusci or Etrusci.
The Greeks denominated the race as Turrhenoi or
Tursenoi, and the ancient Latin name was Tursci.</p>

<p>The engraved records of the Etruscans have hitherto
successfully defied all attempts at interpretation. Now
that the Assyrian and Egyptian records have been read,
these Etruscan inscriptions present the only considerable
philological problem that still remains unsolved.
But that it remains unsolved has not been for want of
effort. A vast amount of ingenuity and of erudition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
has been wasted in attempts to explain the inscriptions
by the aid of Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Phœnician, Arabic,
Ethiopic, Chinese, Coptic, and Basque have all been
tried in vain.</p>

<p>It may be safely affirmed that few of these attempts
have been regarded as satisfactory by any person except
their authors.</p>

<p>A comparison of the Etruscan inscriptions with the
characters of the Finno-Turkic language, a form of
speech employed by those inhabiting the region lying
between the Ural and the Altai Mountains, has, I
believe, resulted with the first and only success that
has ever attended such investigations.</p>

<h2 id="PHOENICIA">PHŒNICIA.</h2>

<p>Alas, we have to dig deep and toil to learn all we
want to know so much about these people who 2500
years ago inhabited that narrow mountain-guarded
strip of land looking westward on the same emerald
sea that to-day breaks on the shore of what is now
Syria.</p>

<p>They have consigned us no books, no pamphlets, no
journals, not a page&mdash;only here and there do we unearth
a graven stone, an inscribed cylinder and Scarabeus;
and with these stone fragments of that nation’s
literary bequests we will hope to obtain some idea of
the history of Phœnicia&mdash;Phœnicia, whose people, not
content with mounting five thousand feet to the temple
of the Casian Jupiter, to see the sun upon the morning
horizon, floated away on their frail barks on the deep
waters, seeking light, knowledge, and gain. Mythology
was their religion, which, like the subjects and styles
of their engraved stones and gems of iridescent antique
paste, was borrowed from Assyria, Greece, and even
somewhat from the myths of the people among whom
many of them settled.</p>

<p>Herodotus speaks of the Phœnicians as a branch of
the Semitic or Aramæan nations; they originally dwelt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
on the shores of the Erythrean Sea. They also occupied
islands in the Persian Gulf, among others Aradus
and Tylus, where temples in Phœnician architecture
were found; and it is known that the Phœnicians left
these islands and colonized in the Ægean and Mediterranean
Seas before the time of Joshua, 1444 <small>B. C.</small></p>

<p>Of the Romans and the Grecians, we have their
history through the writings of their own historians;
and of the Egyptians, by their monuments teeming
with hieroglyphics, history, and theology. Of the
Phœnicians little is extant in writings from their
own people; we are dependent on what other nations
have recorded&mdash;in fact, what we know of them may
be called tradition. The Phœnicians were termed “the
merchants of many isles.” We can hardly say they
cultivated the arts at home, for wherever they went,
there they made their home; on every island inhabited
by them are found evidences of their industry as gem-cutters&mdash;intaglios,
scarabei, and seals. I remember how
I was impressed on going ashore at Syra and walking
through its beautiful amphitheatral city of to-day,
whose site had once known those very Phœnicians,
examples of whose gems may be seen in my collection.</p>

<p>They emigrated as far west as Sardinia. Sardinia
was originally called Sandaleotis, from its form, which
resembles a human foot or its imprint, where during
centuries a moderate harvest has been reaped of gems
emanating from their handiwork.

<p>To a practised eye their work is distinguishable from
that of other nations; the touch, drawing, execution,
and the distinctive character of their subjects render
them readily recognizable. Yet the symbolic characters
are not entirely distinctive, for they often clearly
indicate imitation of Assyrian and Egyptian work and
design. For that reason it is often difficult to decide
or classify gem-objects found in many of the islands
once colonized by them, from the very fact that in
design they at times lack originality.</p>

<p>They were a migratory people, and in this brief
glance at the whole range of our subject we shall be
satisfied with mention of their colony at Tharros, on
the island at Sardinia, where the most unquestionably
authentic Phœnician Scarabei have been found in excavations
made during the last sixty years. They are
principally cut on green jasper, and in character resemble
Persian designs.</p>

<p>In these times we write our history every day on
millions of great pages of white paper. In almost no
contingency will future generations have any difficulty
of learning who we were, where we came from, how we
have formed the master metal&mdash;iron&mdash;into thousands of
implements and instruments, or how they have been
employed; being supplied with our ready inscribed
history, they can begin where we have left off and profit

GREECE.</h2>

<p>The earliest specimens of Greek gems bore traces of
Egyptian style; they represented objects rather symbolically
than by artistic delineation of the beautiful in
the human form or in nature. On the box of Cypselus
death was represented with crooked legs, beauty and
youth by long tresses of hair, power by long hands,
swiftness and agility by long feet. Many of the oldest
Greek statues were accompanied with the names of the
subjects represented, which seems to imply that the
artist was conscious of his deficiency, both in character
and expression. Yet in time they created single
figures and groups in fair marble, whose symmetry and
exquisite modelling of the human form command the
admiration of all. They are either at rest or displaying
the muscles, sinews, and even the passions of athletic
men and adorable women.</p>

<p>Greece was the source of the finest and richest glyptic
art-treasures in a decorative sense. Grecian intaglios
are of superb execution, of exquisite fineness and finish.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
This superiority can in a measure be accounted for by
the encouragement the profession received from the
nation, both from rulers and from the people.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">GREEK AND ROMAN INTAGLIO RINGS.</p></div>

<p>In proportion to the extended cultivation of taste and
the increased demand, the ranks of the incisori were
repleted. Among so many contestants rivalry and
emulation had a very happy effect in forming and
creating artists who were indeed eminent, and whose
works even to-day sparkle as jewel-gems in the diadem
which crowns the history of their place in art.</p>

<p>The perfect finish, polish, and detail of their choicest
examples render them superior to the gems of any other
people, even to many that come from Roman sources.</p>

<p>It is often almost impossible intelligently to explain
the difference between the gems of the Greeks and the
Romans; such power of distinguishing one from the
other is only to be gained by long observation and
close study of the subject.</p>

<p>Many of them, however, seem to say to us whenever
we meet them in exile, “We are of Ancient Greece,
Grecians of the epoch and home of Pericles the patron,
and Phidias the practitioner.” We are reminded of
these classic, silent monuments when we meet and
recognize the strictly glyptic work of the incisori of
the land of the Parthenon. It is by comparison and
contrast that we study and classify their gems. Beautiful
stones have recently been discovered at Mycenæ,
among which are engraved gems bearing effigies of
animals curiously and artistically drawn, and which, by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
their Oriental style, prove that the ancient Greeks, who
bequeathed so much to their successors, also inherited
art-models from a people 1000 years <small>B. C.</small></p>

<p>At first the colonists incised what was known as the
Hellenic style, and then, as they fraternized with the
Romans, and as the Romans made incisions under
the Greek teaching, their glyptic works showed the
Greek influence, and such works constituted the gems
of the Græco-Romano. Many of the intaglios by
Romans, of this school, were signed in Greek characters,
and can be seen in my collection. This act of a
Roman signing his name in characters other than the
Latin letters peculiar to his own country shows how
Grecian art was appreciated in the Græco-Roman epoch.</p>

<p>The classic multitudinous gems of the Roman period:
their emperors, statesmen, warriors, and poets&mdash;in fact,
some of their gems have given to us the only perfect
portraits in miniature that have been preserved from
ancient time; incidents of their conflicts, their sports,
games, and apparel&mdash;with the mass of chimeras and at
times mysteries. The endless grand historical cameos,
some of which in my collection represent nineteen and
even twenty-two figures in good relief carefully engraved
on a single stone. We know that gem-engraving
in Rome in the prolific period was celebrated for
the greatest diversity of subjects both in cameos and
intaglios. Rome, the patroness of the ancient world.</p>

<p>Rome did not achieve this phenomenal position unaided,
though in its palmiest days it was the art shrine
of the nations. To attain this position it drew from
comparatively distant sources, and borrowed talent
wherever it was available.</p>

<p>When Rome’s reputation as the glyptic school was
heralded and established throughout the nations as the
art centre of the world, it became as we have inferred,
the vortex into which hosts of artisans were attracted,
and who, when once there, established themselves.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span></p>

<p>They were well received; were elated with plenty of
occupation, emolument, and good prices; in their new
life they identified themselves with their fellow incisori,
and became Romans, or, at least, Græco-Romans.</p>

<p>In fact, the variety in styles and designs produced by
all the ancient peoples of Italy was due to emigration.
Profiting by the culture and art experience of Etruria,
Rome learned from the Etruscan architects, potters,
die-sinkers, and gem-engravers.</p>

<p>They learned from these more ancient incisori many
useful lessons which enabled them to accomplish wonders.
Within the limited space available on those little
gem stones, they depicted with complicated minuteness
details of events in actual history, and displayed remarkable
tact and astonishing powers of composition in
their rendering of groups of figures and mythological
deities in scenes of quasi historical events.</p>

<p>Though we have seen the work of the Græco-Romans
bearing evidence of combined influence and instruction,
there was even at that very epoch a school, or powerful
class of artists, in Rome, who retained their own individuality,
who were Romans of Rome, and from whose
hands, and from their successors, we have inherited
grand cameos and intaglios, portraying their emperors,
statesmen, philosophers, mythological subjects, and occasionally
groups recording important events in Roman
history.</p>

<p>Considering we find Roman glyptic work of merit
until nearly the close of the second century <small>A. D.</small>, there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
was in all a period of good gem-engraving covering
about eight hundred years.</p>

<p>Throughout all this time the glyptic art flourished
under the protection of kings and emperors, who for
the general encouragement of the civilizing arts, served
their own interests and gratified their tastes for luxury
and the beautiful by their constant patronage of gem-engraving.</p>

<p>The unique mystic gems of the Gnostics, known as
the Abraxas, are a series by themselves; they had no
prototype.</p>

<p>Their strangely decorated and inscribed stone tokens
are so characteristic of the sect that they also are easily
recognized. The task of explaining the meaning of
these incisions is the more difficult, as the veil is
almost impenetrable which obscures the history of everything
that pertains to these little stone fetiches of the
Gnostics.</p>

<p>The very disciples who carried those amuletic gems
did so without understanding the meaning of the marks
and symbols engraved upon them. They evidently
were sacred types of their superstitious creed, invented
and placed there by their mentors or priests.</p>

<p>They were Pagans, Jews, and nominal Christians,
and we find in their inexhaustible inscriptions a series
of emblems, Hebrew and Syriac, which dimly show
forth Christ the Son, and Sun of Righteousness with
ΑΔΟΝΑΙ, and the seven Greek vowels symbolic of the
seven heavens. These Greek vowels have often amused
me when I have shown an Abraxas talisman with long

<p class="caption">ABRAXAS OR GNOSTIC GEMS.</p>

<p>The religion of Jesus Christ was by no means established
peaceably and immediately in the days following
his crucifixion and resurrection. By a close reading of
several of the Epistles of the New Testament you will
see that during the first and second centuries many
were the beliefs and even schisms among those who
thought that they believed in Christ. In the second
Epistle to the Corinthians there is evidence that the
learned doctors raised altar in opposition to altar.
None of them were avowedly reared by the Gnostics,
yet the Apostle Paul recognized their opposition to the
orthodox growing faith and combated them, knowing
that Christianity at that critical moment was constantly
losing adherents who, through the sophistries of the
Abraxas, were daily relinquishing their ardent hold on
the new hope in Christ.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly this Abraxas sect, who made so many
cabalistic talismans, which were so blindly accepted
and worn by their disciples, had among them many
who knew of our Saviour. It appears from history,
and from their mystic characters, that they had a
clearer appreciation of Christ than a just or reasonable
fear of the prince of the region of darkness, as Zoroaster
termed the chief of inferno. They derived their idea of
Satan, the arch tempter, from the appellation given him
by certain sects in Central Asia, where, to better deceive
their victims, they spoke of him as an angel of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
light. In modern times the lives of many men have
proved that they had no desire to repulse Satan, but
rather lived harmoniously in fellowship with him as
their guide.</p>

<p>St. Paul besought the Christians to guard well the
precious truths revealed and confided to them, and to
fear and fly from the profane novelties that were threatening
the welfare of their souls (I. Timothy, vi).</p>

<p>In a word, these great pagan monuments were the
forerunners and the models of many of the small and
portable talismans that were freely disseminated by the
priests of the Abraxas to their disciples and their followers.</p>

<p>One important fact must be understood. The signs,
symbols, the unintelligible hieroglyphs of the Gnostics,
the Basilidians, which we find on the Abraxas gems&mdash;almost
all talismans&mdash;are the mystic representations of
a sect thus made up of people of several nations, all of
whom in their aspirations sought for knowledge of the
invisible power, that unquestionably had created and
who governed all things, whom, though unseen, they
served and feared.</p>

<h2 id="EARLY_CHRISTIANS">EARLY CHRISTIANS.</h2>

<p>The events narrated in the New Testament of our
Lord Jesus Christ resulted in the drawing together of
his followers, who daily sought to worship their risen
Redeemer, notwithstanding the terrible opposition of
the heathen autocrats of Rome.</p>

<p>Very naturally in proportion to the imperial opposition
the faithful became more fervent. As they could
not publicly meet for worship and prayer, they were
compelled to do so clandestinely.</p>

<p>Now in order that only the faithful should enter, and
that the enemies might be detected, a system of tesseræ
was invented, and soon these were made in the form of
engraved pietradura; the designs always were of the
simplest character&mdash;a dove, two or three fish, two
palms crossed, etc., and other religious gem-tokens;
this formed the glyptic epoch known as the Early
Christian gems.</p>

<p>Be it understood, there was no representation of
“God,” the “Father,” or of “Christ;” only simple
symbols of the class already described; symbols of
their simple faith.</p>

<p>This was a period of glyptic work in which a series
of gems were engraved by a people who pursued their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
avocation under peculiarly trying circumstances; they
were the “Early Christians.”</p>

<p>The children born of those who had already espoused
the new doctrine were taught with the first lessons of
life to know, to revere, and to trust in the Saviour;
with their earliest lisping words, from the cradle they
learned to plead in prayer for divine protection.</p>

<p>The earliest Christians, the first converts, born in
paganism, had not the opportunities with which their
offspring and descendants were favored; they had to
renounce the superstitions in which they had been
reared, and were often obliged to sever the friendly ties
of youth.</p>

<p>These first enrolled with the followers of Christ,
pagans, whose convictions impelled them to accept the
Redeemer, offered to their inquiring hearts, commenced
anew lives with many pagan prejudices and customs
clinging to them.</p>

<p>Some of them were incisori, and it is interesting to
observe among the comparatively few gems of this
epoch the evidence of transition. Many of these gems
unquestionably bearing some of the simpler Christian
decoration were still adorned with pagan designs. On
one we find Astarte; on others, Serapis, Mercury, Venus,
or Apollo. The divinity, the loveliness of expression
sometimes given to these transition portraits seem to
have been the work of artists whose souls were imbued
with the singular beauty of that Divine Man whom
Publius Lentulus announced to the Senate as “the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
prophet of truth,” a man whose personal beauty excelled
all human creatures&mdash;and yet the effigy really
was of some pagan deity. These gems, however, which
were characterized by remnants of pagan decoration,
were only of the epoch immediately succeeding the institution
of the sect of “followers of Christ,” and preceding
the dawning struggle of the “Early Christians,”
to establish their belief and to retain their rights as citizens.
They renounced the idolatrous religion of the
nation, and their glyptic work was generally typical of
the purity and simplicity of their faith and their devotion
to its observance.</p>

<p>One might naturally suppose that the gems of the
early Christians would abound in representations of
scriptural events and incidents of the life of Christ.
Such was not the case; these subjects were abundantly
produced by the Byzantines about the fifth century
<small>A. D.</small> This can be accounted for from the fact that
most of these subject-gems were engraved to decorate
the sacred vessels and paraphernalia of the church
altars in Byzantium.</p>

<p>With Constantine we find the Byzantine epoch in its
maturity. With the simplicity of the early Christians
we have remarked that everything like representation
of the Godhead was eliminated or rather forbidden.</p>

<p>It was the Byzantines who created for the gem
market token cameos and intaglios on which were incised
effigies of the Holy Family, and incidents in
every phase in that series of events that never has
been equalled in historic interest in the records of time:
the birth, life, trial, sufferings, death, and resurrection
of the Son of God.</p>

<p>Elaborate details characterized the cameos picturing
the triumphs of that Christian emperor and the portraiture
of his mother Helena.

<p>The annunciation, the visitation, the birth in the
manger, the adoration of the wise men and the magi,
the bearing of the cross, the crucifixion, etc.</p>

<p>With the Byzantine epoch we meet with the Emperor
Constantine as we turn from the first period of decadence,
in fact, almost demise, of the art of the incisori.</p>

<p>The justice, energy, and enterprise of Constantine
showered benefits on all industrious men in the Eastern
Roman world. Skilled workmen, spared from the
absorbing conflicts of war, anew devoted themselves in
peace to their mechanical avocations.</p>

<p>Prosperity ruled and was assured to the people. Foremost
among these artisans were the gem-engravers; the
demand for their glyptic productions, and the amount
produced, was phenomenal.</p>

<p>The dignity of Constantine’s successful empire was
sustained by a retinue of courtiers; luxury characterized
all the imperial decorations of his palace.</p>

<p>His willing subjects supplied his demands and gratified
his refined tastes by zealously executing his liberal
commands in all branches of art, and especially in the
art of gem-engraving, which contributed largely to the
court adornment.</p>

<p>Recognizing the near relationship between gems and
coins, we here see that Constantine, shortly after he had
established his empire in Byzantium, removed the pagan
emblems from the coins of the empire, and issued others
on which he caused to be impressed the legend illustrating
and recording the peculiar incident of his conversion;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
to this was added a phœnix, emblematic of the
renovation of his empire, together with the monogram
of Christ, and the Angel of Victory, which in his vision
had directed his course at the time of his conversion to
Christianity and triumph over the pagan enemy.</p>

<p>At the time of his baptism at Nicomedia he clad
himself in a white robe, and from that time he never
resumed the imperial purple.</p>

<p>This incident was also engraved, and formed the subject
of a design on a later coin.</p>

<p>The engravers employed by Constantine were incisori
of the highest rank of that period; none others were in
favor. They executed portraits of his family, of his wife
Fausta, of his sons, and of himself&mdash;in combat, in bust,
on horseback, in imperial power; always laureated, and
principally on cameos, very few intaglios being cut at
this time.</p>

<p>Several important examples have survived the rack
and ruin of time, and may be seen in the Bibliothèque
Nationale at Paris, the British Museum at London, the
Royal and Imperial Collections of Vienna and St.
Petersburg, and in my collection.</p>

<p>These unique gems, those commissioned by Constantine,
however, form a small proportion of the glyptic
harvest from the Byzantine period. With Constantine
commences the series of scriptural cameos, which continue
during several years in Byzantia.</p>

<p>The great number of cameos preserved from this
epoch bearing scriptural subjects, which were ordered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
and engraved for reliquaries and every description of
vessels, and for the adornment of altar book-bindings,
for church and cathedral ceremonies, far exceeds in
quantity those imperial portraits, and to an appreciator
of distinctive specialties in a representative art collection
they are more interesting.</p>

<div class="tdc">
<img id="i_073" src="images/i_073.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">BYZANTINE.</p></div>

<p>After a few heads of Christ attributed to the Sassanians,
we meet in the reign of Constantine the first gem
portraits of our Saviour. These sacred portraits, even
at times rudely rendered, have often more divinity in
them than many similar subjects of a later period.</p>

<p>The distinctive, most characteristic, Byzantine gems
are the large series of scriptural cameos, designed in
relief for the ornamentation of the sacred vessels and
other paraphernalia on the altars of the churches at
the Byzantine capital.</p>

<h2 id="MEDIAEVAL">MEDIÆVAL.</h2>

<p>The era in the decline in art was sensibly marked in
the glyptic branch. The very rude and often grotesquely
drawn designs we meet in this long period,
the Middle Ages, may well be termed the dark days.</p>

<p>The eras of art in the history of nations have been
marked by the same changing characteristics; light
has invariably been succeeded by darkness; there are
shadows ever following the bright rays of the sun.
This day of imagery and sculpture, feeble at its dawn,
radiant in its morning, powerful in the glory and effulgence
of its meridian, deteriorated as evening advanced,
faded in the twilight, was at last veiled in the long
period of decadence&mdash;the Middle Ages, the night of art.</p>

<p>These people, so credulous and so trusting in these
token-stones, by degrees formed themselves into groups,
at first of two or three, with ties of pious friendship;
subsequently these associations gradually increased in
the numbers of their adherents until the growing fanatic
idea of closing one’s eyes on the sinful world was the
incentive which formed at first asylums, and soon after
monasteries; and the monastic life became popular;
wavering men, feeling themselves too weak to face the
temptations of the world, resorted to these holy retreats
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
and there sought God. Few reasonable men can be
truly happy without occupation, and, happily for us,
these recluses saw the importance and the historic interest
of engraved gems. Many interesting intaglios
were thus spared from loss and destruction.</p>

<p>The numerous orders of monks during this barbarous
epoch collected all that possibly could be saved from
the destroying avalanche, and with great diligence transcribed
on parchment types of the existing literature.</p>

<p>The laborers in the limited field of art in the Middle
Ages were these dwellers in monasteries. To them we
are indebted for some rude fibres in the fabric with
which this period of darkness is canopied; they walked
under it in the simplicity of monastic life; and to us at
least it conveys the lesson that man has forgotten so
much, knows so little, and has so much to learn.</p>

<p>Their intaglios were generally of a spiritual and devotional
character, though some of them relieved the
tedium of cloister life by creating in <i>basso-rilievo</i> on
bone and ivory the most ludicrous and mirth-provoking
designs.</p>

<p>The subjects of the engraved gems of the eighth,
ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries are to a great
extent unmeaning figures and heads&mdash;portraits of
unknown personages, now and then reproductions of
ancient Roman emperors and military heroes of historic
renown, yet poorly rendered and bad in execution.</p>

<p>There are also many inexplicable subjects, portraying
groups of three four, five, and six figures, evidently intended
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
to commemorate events in history; also mythological
processions, both in rude intaglios and equally
mediocre cameos, giving triumphs of Silenus and Bacchus,
portraying these heroes in forms, the drawing of
which would raise blushes on their cheeks could they
return to earth and be allowed to criticise their effigies.
Silenus, even full of wine, would have growled and remonstrated,
and would have pronounced some of them
absurd misrepresentations; they, however, are very interesting,
if only on account of their contrast with the
examples of Greek and Roman glyptic art.</p>

<p class="figcenter">
<img id="i_078" src="images/i_078.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>In this epoch, again, we find instances of the sensitiveness
of the numismatic branch of the art of gem-engraving,
for the models of all pieces of money are
intaglios, and thus far they are related to the glyptic
art; and it has always been the first industry giving
evidence of a decline.</p>

<p>The view of these relics of cloister art convinces us
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
that they of the dark ages did not contribute the truly
beautiful.... Yet shadows pass “with time and the
hour.”... Night is passing, ... comes the gray, ...
comes the dawn, ... comes the morning light. Creatures
that at evening ceased their song, tune now their
pipes and sing again; they chant anon the requiem of
the Night of Art; and yet anon, they sing the coming
of the light. They celebrate at last, with hope, the
renewing of all things beautiful in art. The orb of day
gilds the horizon; man beholds the aurora of approaching
day.

<h2 id="RENAISSANCE">RENAISSANCE.</h2>

<p>In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, under the
encouragement of the Medici family, skilled artisans
again emigrated to Italy as coadjutors in the great
revival of all that was beautiful in gem-engraving.</p>

<p>They created, for the glyptic phase of art, a position
almost as important as it had enjoyed in the first century
<small>A. D.</small></p>

<p>It is not surprising that comparatively so few engraved
gems have been handed down to us when we
consider the tides of the last twenty centuries as a great
sea which has borne to the shores of civilized Europe,
and later to America, specimens of ancient art creations&mdash;that
sea, at times placid, yet ever and anon turbulent
with devastating storms, whose iconoclastic waves broke
upon the ancient sites of antiquity, destroying treasures
that thus have been irreparably lost to archæological
science and to our museums.</p>

<p>As a child becomes restless with the consciousness of
coming day before it fully wakes from sleep, man, weary
of this night of ignorance and the atmosphere of barbarism&mdash;fretful
on his couch under the yoke of tyranny,
striving to shake it off while yet enveloped by the shades

<p>He burst the cords that bound his strength; he
pierced the clouds which dulled his vision, and, leaving
his prison-house, reached forth his fearless arm,
and pushing aside the sombre folds of the long intervening
veil, peered into the outer world of progress, and
in the gray gloom he descried a distant terrace. With
rapid strides, through furrows of popular prejudice and
cinders of past magnificence, over crumbled arch and
fallen pillar, frieze, and pediment, he sped his way; nor
flagged nor halted, till the summit reached, he stood
and gazed with earnest look out into the coming time;
he beheld in the vista before him many streams flowing
into the sea of the future. In the horizon gleamed again
the omen of coming day; it was the harbinger of a new
birth.</p>

<p>The light of truth flashed upon his mind, discovering
to him his freed intellect. Unlike the denizens of the
earlier age of luxury and repletion, he stood a thinking
man, refreshed, invigorated, and ready for work; and
quickly he applied himself; called forth his kinsman;
his voice was heard throughout the land; men awoke
everywhere and wrought in the ateliers of the new life.</p>

<p>Through the air came strains as of music, from creaking
of timber, cracking of stone, the carol of the painter,
hammer and anvil, plashing oar, wheel and shaft, mallet
and chisel, and with the new demand upon the gem-engravers
came&mdash;the Oratorio of the Renaissance.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>

<p>With this awakening came another influx of skilled
artisans into Italy, not to compete, as before, in the
great established art market of the world. Now they
came in response to appeals for master-workmen, came
to instruct, to encourage the new birth; to lead the
drowsy ones out into the full light of day, the day of a
rising constellation in which once more shone brilliantly
a meritorious school of gem-engravers.</p>

<p>Though Germany, France, and other nations shared in
the work, Italy guarded the cradle of the Renaissance,
and as a faithful, loving parent, watched the developing
features of the youth, which grew apace, reading there
the promise of a growing power that was destined to
lead future generations to excellence and prosperity
in art.</p>

<p>Italy accomplished the first great work of this period
by furnishing models for both industrial and fine arts,
infusing vitality into other nations. The influential
families of the Medici and Farnese, Popes Leo X. and
Paul III., many cardinals and nobles, were instrumental
in the revival of gem-engraving; especially Lorenzo de
Medici contributed to its redevelopment and growth by
inducing artists to devote themselves to its practice and
bestowing on them his liberal patronage.</p>

<p>The vigorous manner of artists of this period is so
marked that even in the reproduction of antique designs
a connoisseur can recognize their peculiar style. Their
original works are highly meritorious, attaining a great
degree of excellence. Many rose to eminence; some,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
not content with rising in the firmanent of the dawning
effulgence, aspired to positions in the bright constellation
of fame, producing engraved gems for the ornamentation
of costumes, armor, inlaying and embossing
of vases, tankards, etc.</p>

<h2 id="SUCCEEDING_DECLINES_AND_REVIVALS">SUCCEEDING DECLINES AND REVIVALS.</h2>

<p>Constant encouragement was given to this branch
of art-industry throughout the fifteenth and part of the
sixteenth century; but after the death of the Emperor
Charles V., in 1558, recurred another period of decline.
Private and royal accumulations of art works were
again the victims of depredation; cabinets and museums
were pillaged and scattered by military marauders, as
one after another the great cities of the Continent of
Europe were besieged and conquered.</p>

<p>The glyptic, of all the arts, was the most easily
affected by the changing fortunes of nations.</p>

<p>These circumstances compelled artists to give their
attention more particularly to church architecture, to
the production of large devotional basso-rilievos for the
altar, and sculptured figures, which, though representing
sacred subjects, were often too voluptuous in form,
and lacking the essential qualities of true art.</p>

<p>In the last twenty years of the eighteenth century
gem-engraving received fresh impetus; new practitioners
were enrolled from Germany, England, and France.</p>

<p>Some of these resided many years in England, pursuing
their profession assiduously and profitably. In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
this period quantities of intaglios and cameos were
reproduced from the most salable antique subjects. To
supply the wants of enthusiastic amateurs frauds were
freely committed, by close imitation, and the insertion
of signatures of celebrated Greek and Roman engravers,
though the age produced artists of the highest ability
and honor.</p>

<p>The works of Natter, Sirletti, Pickler, Marchand,
Pistrucci, Santarelli, and others come to us so directly
from their hands that we feel they almost belong to our
day, and we think of them as of acquaintances.</p>

<p class="figcenter">
<img id="i_087" src="images/i_087.jpg" alt="" /><br /></p>

<p>Many of the gems of Giovanni Pickler compare favorably
with the finest incisions of the Greek, and even with
the work of the renowned Dioscorides.</p>

<p>During the latter part of the eighteenth century
and the commencement of the nineteenth, monarchs and
noblemen indulged in making collections of gems to
such an extent that the list of patrons increased competition,
and fabulous prices were obtained from such
buyers as the Empress Catherine II. of Russia, the
Prince Frederick of Prussia, the Duke of Orleans,
George III., the Empress Josephine of France, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
many of the English nobility, among others the Dukes
of Devonshire and Marlborough.</p>

<p>Almost until now no plea has been offered for glyptology
as a factor contributing historical data. The
mass of scientists have been contented with musty old
volumes, and these little message-bearing stones have
been regarded as nothing more than curious ancient
articles of luxury, yet you will remark we do not look
on them in that light; we recognize, as we justly should,
each and every piece as part of a great story, recording
and illustrating many epochs and eras in this world’s
history, and patiently we have been seeking to replace
each fragment into its proper place in the inscribed
diagram, until we are convinced that we read thereon
many things that no manuscripts or books have communicated
to us.

<h2 id="SOME_TYPES_OF_REMARKABLE_GEMS">SOME TYPES OF REMARKABLE GEMS.</h2>

<p>My entire collection in the Free Museum of Science
and Art of the University of Pennsylvania must be
examined to see types of all these epochs. It may be
well to notice here three or four very remarkable gems
of which monographs have also been published.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Bacchus and Ariadne.</span></h3>

<p>Ariadne is seated on the rocks of Dia, where Bacchus
found her; at her feet is her panther. Bacchus bears
in his hand a thrysus; his javelin with its point in the
form of a pine cone; his head wreathed with ivy and
grape leaves; his hand lovingly placed on sad Ariadne’s
shoulder, who has just been deserted by Theseus.
Bacchus, deeply in love (which is indicated by the
figure of Cupid), says to her, “I shall care for thee.”
The panther at the feet of Ariadne is emblematic of
the principal and most important incident in her life,
her love for Theseus.</p>

<p>Ariadne was the daughter of Minos, King of Crete.
She fell in love with Theseus when he went as one of
the seven youths whom the Athenians were obliged to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
send every year with seven maidens to Crete to be
devoured by the Minotaur.</p>

<p>Ariadne provided Theseus with a sword with which
he slew the Minotaur, and with a thread which enabled
him to find his way out of the labyrinth; they then fled
to the island of Naxos (Dia), where Theseus, warned by
a god in a dream, deserted her. Bacchus arrived opportunely
from India, finding Ariadne in a state of
grief and consternation, which even added to her charming
beauty; he quenched her tears, consoled her, and
took her to himself. This exquisite gem is a fine representation
of Renaissance work (see plate on p. 81).</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Jupiter Ægiochus.</span></h3>

<p>Among examples of antique glyptic art, by referring
to my late work on “Engraved Gems: Their Place in
the History of Art,” you will find an extended notice
of the superb ancient cameo on chrysoprase of Jupiter
Ægiochus. It is the eighth of importance in the remarkable
antique cameos that have been preserved from
the early centuries after Christ. It is of remarkable
dimensions, being 167 millimetres in height by 130
millimetres in breadth.</p>

<p>It is of the close of the epoch of Marcus Aurelius or
the earlier years of the reign of Commodus. The style
is that of the Græco-Roman art. The work is very
beautiful for that epoch, and there rests in this head of
the master of the gods an accent of grandeur in which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
one feels the reflection of the original Greek of the
better centuries, imitated here by the engraver of the
Græco-Roman age.</p>

<p class="figcenter">
<img id="i_091" src="images/i_091.jpg" alt="" /><br /></p>

<p class="caption">JUPITER ÆGIOCHUS.</p>

<p>It is an interesting circumstance, which merits particular
attention, that the cameo Zulian coming from
Ephesus and this Jupiter Ægiochus are certainly of
the workmanship of Asia Minor.</p>

<p>Early in this century this cameo made part of the
celebrated Northwick Collection of England. Afterwards
it was acquired by a wealthy connoisseur in
France, and later passed into the possession of M.
Feuardent, Paris, when, with his permission, an engraving
of it appeared, with five quarto pages of text
and notes, in the <i>Gazette Archæologique</i>, Paris, 1877,
edited by Baron J. De Witte, Membre de l’Institut and
François Lenormant.</p>

<p>M. Adrien Longperier, the distinguished glyptologist
and savant of the Institut de France, some thirty years
ago made a study of this gem, and seriously contemplated
its acquisition for France; he urged the French
Government to authorize its purchase for the collection
in the Salle des Pierres gravées in the Bibliothèque
Nationale, Paris, or for the Museum of the Louvre.
Several other museums also negotiated for its purchase,
but the late owner being firm in his demand, the price
caused them to delay, and now it belongs to America,
being part of my collection.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Triumph of Constantine.</span></h3>

<p>Among the most important and interesting antique
gems in my collection is one engraved when Constantine
held the Roman Empire in Byzantia, which came
into the possession of the Court of Russia.</p>

<p>The Empress Catherine II., wishing to confer a great
favor and special reward on an ambassador to her court
from her remarkable collection in the Museum of the
Hermitage at St. Petersburg, presented this antique
gem to him in 1785. Twenty-five years afterwards, at
his death in Greece, it was sold, and was piously
guarded during thirty years by a collector in the
Hellenic peninsula. After that it became the property
of Bieler in Styria.</p>

<p>I came into possession of this remarkable gem after
more than five years’ negotiations with its owner, and
subsequently with his heirs.</p>

<p>It is a cameo of great importance in itself. Prof. C.
W. King, of Trinity College, Cambridge, England, said,
“It is by far the most important of all similar works of
the Lower Empire hitherto published.”</p>

<p>It is of very considerable dimensions (6 × 4 inches),
being the eleventh in point of magnitude of those already
existing in any cabinet. It is a maculated sard, dark-reddish
amber color, with slight white, dark sepia, and
burnt sienna spots or maculation.</p>

<p>The subject is a Triumph of Constantine. This portrait
of that Byzantine Emperor is considered very faithful.

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
As I have often remarked in connection with the
numismatic phase of my subject, we can in this case
establish the likeness of Constantine by confronting it
with the fine gold coins of his realm and reign.</p>

<p class="figcenter">
<img id="i_095" src="images/i_095.jpg" alt="" /><br /></p>

<p>Among the auxiliary figures on the gem is Constantine’s
mother Helena, she who found the true cross;
also Crispus his son, and his wife Fausta.</p>

<p>The Emperor is being crowned by a Victory, who
stands behind him borne in a triumphal car, the four
horses walking and led by a soldier in front. Constantine
holds the reins in his left hand, but in his right a
roll of paper (volumen), instead of the customary eagle-tipped
sceptre.</p>

<p>In the front of the group is a standard inscribed
“S. P. Q. R.,” the bearer of the staff being concealed
by the horses of the car; as are also the lictors, whose
fasces are seen elevated in the air above the horses’
backs, in the upper field of the composition. Behind
the car stands Crispus and Fausta, both in front
face; Crispus is pointing to the labarum, and evidently
relating to Fausta all the circumstances of its introduction
into the scene. At the opposite end of the gem
stands Helena, who, with the soldier leading the quadriga,
forms a balance to the other pair.</p>

<p>Much labor and skill have been expended by the artist
upon the face of the triumphing Cæsar, in order to leave
no doubt as to his identity, and with such success that
the well-known Augustus-like profile of Constantine
may be recognized at the first glance.

<p>We have found here unquestionably information not
to be obtained from any other source. If ancient engraved
stones had never been unearthed or found, we
would have been ignorant to-day of much that is interesting
and important concerning the historic chain
which now connects us with the traditions of men in
the incipiency of art thousands of years before the era
of manuscripts.</p>

<p>We hold and esteem the Holy Bible not only as our
guide and as the book of God’s laws, but also as one of
the most perfect compends of the history of the world
from all known time. The earliest mention of the profession
of gem-cutting is in the thirty-first chapter of
Exodus, from the first to the fifth verse, inclusive:</p>

<p>“And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, See, I
have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son
of Hur, of the tribe of Judah: and I have filled him
with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding,
and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,
to devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in
silver, and in brass, and in cutting of stones, to set
them,” etc., “and to work in all manner of workmanship.”
This commission was for the Jews to adorn the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
ark of the testimony and to attach to the Esod a part of
the vestiture of the grand sacerdotal of the Israelites.
Our observation of this branch of art has been strictly
in accordance with our intended plan.</p>

<p>We have regarded almost solely all these beautiful
stones in the light of art, with a view of considering
their comparative art-merits; yet I have always seen
in their history another and somewhat important phase,
to me an interesting one: that is, their connection with
the traditions, legends, and annals of religion. We
find on them tenets of paganism, mysticism, mythology,
and the Christian religion&mdash;symbols, dogmas, and pictured
revelations of creeds of many nations and of people
almost otherwise unknown&mdash;what may indeed be
classified as religious stone-literature.</p>

<p>Skilful utilization of the colored strata and maculation
of onyxes and agates depict fire and water as objects of
adoration; altars rendered sacred by their inscriptions,
each with its patron god upon it or hovering near;
characters there inscribed telling to whose service they
were dedicated&mdash;now to a supreme being beloved,
though absent; again, to a deity adored, though unseen.</p>

<p>Every tribe seems to have had a Father above,
though we do not meet with the vague superscription,
“To the unknown God.”</p>

<p>On every side objects of veneration: the heavens;
innumerable mention of deities dwelling therein; plenteous
aspirations and appeals to their clemency, forbearance,
and protection.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span></p>

<p>These talismanic gems, whenever they are religiously
inscribed, I treasure as tablets of faith&mdash;a faith which,
though often erroneously placed, was fervent and abiding
as it was indelibly registered.</p>

<p>Rambling in many strange countries, seeing palaces,
costumes, men, and manners, this subject, paramount
to them all, has often received my attention&mdash;a theme
the most precious to the scattered races of the human
family, their religion. It is worthy of remark that so
large a proportion of the intaglios and seals were of a
religious character.</p>

<p>The ancient residents near the sea and on all the
frontier of Asia Minor had their religious token-gems.</p>

<p>In this day of enlightenment naturally we are astonished
that men could have believed in these gods or in
such theories and dogmas, and expressing astonishment
that they could have trusted in these talismans or
hoped for benefits from them. We wonder at the
absurd codes of mythological religion; yes, let us call
it so; that is what it was for these people; they knew
not our God, they had never heard of our divine Master.</p>

<p>Until the revelation of Christ to us, man naturally
had to look somewhere for refuge for his soul; he had
to cling to some unseen hand, lest he should fall.</p>

<p>Do we often realize what modern Christianity is?
These pagans, of whose religions we have so many
little stone monuments, were all anterior to and existed
during ages before that revelation.</p>

<p>Christians of to-day, reflect: all these heathen, as you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
no doubt esteem them, were earnest in the performance
of their duties, their prayers, their adoration, and their
sacrifices&mdash;many of them more devout than some of us
under the light of the twentieth century.</p>

<p>True, these religions were the inventions of men, the
outcome of the longings and yearnings of sympathetic
men for a superior guiding and protecting power&mdash;Deity,
if you will allow it&mdash;to which to turn and in
which to hope.</p>

<p>They worshipped faithfully, adored sincerely, obeyed
implicitly, lived simple lives, in keeping with their
primitive faith. Was it not reasonable, this worship
of a people who had no divine revelation? Was it
not beautiful? Can you not even now see something
to admire in devotional exercises held in God’s open air,
turning in adoration myriads of earnest eyes upon the
Sun, “the beauty and the glory of the day,” devoutly
praising from the heart the majesty and the power of
the Supreme Being, the Maker and the Ruler of this
benign light? Their principal fête, on which they all
assembled joyfully and gratefully to bow before the
glorious orb, was on the same day we have accepted
as the anniversary of the birth of Christ our Redeemer.</p>

<p>And so it was with those who venerated and carried
engraved emblems of those incomprehensible elements,
Fire and Water.</p>

<p>As symbolic of the inscrutable power the Parsees
keep a flame constantly burning upon an altar in the
inner temple; so sacred is it that only the higher
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
priests set apart for that service can enter therein;
yet through their mediation thousands participate in
the ceremony and enjoy the consolation of its power&mdash;a
force of terrible destructibility, yet with the genial
phase which comforts and contributes to the nourishment
of man. This form of worship originated in
Persia, and when its disciples emigrated and distributed
themselves throughout many countries and islands
of India and the shores of the neighboring seas, they
carefully carried the sacred fire with them; and it is
believed it has never ceased to burn during many centuries.
Red and spotted maculation in agates have
been utilized by incisori to represent the flame of an
altar fire.</p>

<p>Even to this day many of these objects in stone are
treasured and valued by men and women in secluded
villages in the East; they hold and guard them as
religious heirlooms. I have bartered with them successfully,
and have bought their bracelets, finger-rings,
and nose-rings; yet so highly have these sacred talismans
been esteemed that those which I most desired
have rarely and only with difficulty been obtained from
their superstitious possessors.</p>

<p>In the two or three centuries succeeding the advent
of Christ the Abraxas flourished and engraved the mass
of religious mystic talismans (already described in their
place in this book). Their priests or pastors, in the
term accepted by us, prepared these amulets, engraving
upon them attributes and symbols of the Most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
High; they taught their followers to wear them close
to their hearts, these reminders of their heavenly Father,
these rude glyptic lights that kept them nearer to God.
I do not, cannot, find it absurd. When you have considered
this subject as now presented, you will perhaps
view with new interest these devotional tokens, after
many years of travel and research brought together
and classified in my cabinet.</p>

<h2 id="HISTORIC_CAMEOS">HISTORIC CAMEOS.</h2>

<p>A large class of ancient seems were historical. In
my collection may be found a series of cameos, all
works of the most able artists of the epoch of Trajan,
which are now esteemed in Rome as works of the
highest merit.</p>

<p>They portray the pleasures of the hunting expeditions,
the wars, and other incidents in the life of Trajan
and Titus Vespasianus.</p>

<p>These cameos were the subjects of the <i>basso-rilievos</i>
which ornamented a triumphal arch erected in honor
of Trajan.</p>

<p>In the reign of the Emperor Constantine the Romans
despoiled this monument of all these subjects tributary
to Trajan, and adorned with them the arch which they
then built for Constantine. It was said in those days
no emperor had ever equalled Constantine in building
up the Empire, and therefore they did not hesitate to
dismantle a monument of his predecessor.</p>

<p>An interesting historic cameo is Coriolanus visited
by his mother Veturia and his wife Volumnia. His
original name was Marcius, but on account of his valor
in a contest against the Volscians he was surnamed
Coriolanus. In the time of a famine he was impeached
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
for his opinions in regard to the distribution of corn
received from Sicily; he was condemned to exile. He
now went over to the Volscians, and became general
of their army, and successfully attacked the Romans;
they, fearing him, made advances to him and offered
the restoration of all his property and franchises; he
resisted all their propositions. It was not until his
mother and wife came to him that he could be induced
to relent; their prayers and tears, however, moved him;
he then retired with his army, but passed the remainder
of his life with the Volscians, who had honored him for
his valor and not from fear. The guard with a shield
at the right is a Volscian, and he at the left is a
Roman.</p>

<p class="figcenter">
<img id="i_107" src="images/i_107.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Observe in my collection an allocution of Marcus
Aurelius before the Prætorian Guard: the guard are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
not only known by their costume, but by the banner
which is marked S. C. (<i>Senatus Consultum</i>).</p>

<p>No incidents in ancient history are more interesting or
more dramatic than the episodes in the life and career of
fair Cleopatra; one of the most vivid to my fancy’s recollection
is the scene of her fatal giving up of that romantic
life as depicted on a beautiful turquoise cameo&mdash;No. 346.</p>

<p>It is well understood that many of the cameos concerning
Christ are truly historical. There is also Horatius
defending the bridge. The bridge was on the
Tiber at Rome; Horatius was fighting the Etruscans;
the Romans were obliged to destroy their end of the
bridge, when Horatius with his horse swam back.</p>

<p>True, we have history through classic Latin sources
of the most important events of the first and second
centuries. Yet these portraitures on stone, executed
in the very epochs, add certainly great interest to the
records of these times. The subjects on stone alluded
to, mirror to us more faithfully, more vividly, scenes in
the lives of several Roman emperors than any manuscript
possibly could have done.</p>

<p>We have Trajan as emperor, judge, and warrior. We
see him engaged in conflict, we admire him victorious,
we rejoice in his happy return to Rome on several occasions;
in his triumphant reception both by the people
and the army, and in the arches erected as souvenirs of
his prowess; in his dignified reception of the son of the
King of the Armenians, and in his condescension in
restoring their kingdom; in several of his expeditions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
against the Dacians, and in his happy escape from the
plot of Decebalus. We have instances of his public
charities delicately depicted in cameo; his religious
sacrifices; his exploits as a hunter of many wild animals,
the boar and the lion included, are exemplified.
We have several beautiful groups with emperors delivering
allocutions before the cohorts of their armies,
senators, and other dignitaries; the triumphant entry
of Titus Vespasianus into Jerusalem, whereon twenty-two
figures are visible, and the exit from Jerusalem of
his victorious army, on which nineteen figures are seen;
also the groups of Jewish prisoners.</p>

<p>All these pages in my stone book are certainly
interesting additions to ancient history.

<h2 id="ANIMALS_AND_BIRDS">ANIMALS AND BIRDS.</h2>

<p>We have seen how large a proportion of the subjects
on ancient gems were mythological, how extended was
the class of religious and of Christian subjects; we
have noted the loved portraits of sovereigns, statesmen,
philosophers, physicians, and poets.</p>

<p>There remains a series worthy of notice&mdash;those
intaglios and cameos worn as amulets on which were
engraved innumerable animals, birds, fishes, and even
insects.</p>

<p>As the families of the nobility chose the insignia
which entered into the quarterings of their escutcheons,
so the ancients according to their superstitions or their
tastes chose some patron animal or bird for an emblem
and caused it to be engraved on their talismans; and
these symbols were cherished with what might almost
be termed religious fervency.</p>

<p>They were used as amulets, supposed to protect
the wearers against accident and to repel danger.
There was almost a pharmacopœia of gems, with
solace for every trouble of mind and a remedy for
every disease.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span></p>

<p>A dolphin, the mariner’s friend, on sard or carnelian,
was an emblem worn by fishermen, and was believed
to protect them from the attacks of sharks or other
voracious fishes. They also carried with equal reliance
the same design in antique paste.</p>

<p>The eagle of Jupiter is symbolic of his power,
although it was subservient to him. This no doubt
accounts for its appropriation in heraldry by sovereigns.</p>

<p>The raven, the friend of Apollo; the parrot, a loquacious
inebriate, is often an attendant on Bacchus.</p>

<p>The aringa, a fish of the Adriatic Sea, represented on
a talisman in my collection, was worn by women on account
of its being the symbol of fruitfulness; it deposits
many thousand eggs each year.</p>

<p>Certain insects, arachnids, and reptiles were employed
as symbols, because they were supposed to
protect man in each case from the enemy thereon
delineated.</p>

<p>A scorpion on a transparent stone was an amulet
against the sting of the arachnid.</p>

<p>As the scorpion inflicts a painful sting, the spider a
venomous bite, and a variety of flies make dangerous
aggression on the human form, their images engraved
on stones were believed to shield the wearer from the
ills due to attacks from corresponding insects.</p>

<p>One of the most minute insects employed as a talisman
is the ant, symbolic of industry.</p>

<p>The peacock frequently appears on gems; naturally,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
no one would have had it as an emblem of vanity, in
which sense it is generally accepted in modern times,
but it was revered as the favorite of Juno.</p>

<p>The owl: Minerva’s head is at times draped with
an owl; its connection with Minerva is that it is symbolic
of profound meditation.</p>

<p>Beautiful storks occur frequently on engraved
gems: they were so abundant in Asia Minor and in
the Byzantine Empire that husbandmen sought to
frighten them away; yet in other lands they were
almost adored. In modern Fünen, and generally in
Scandinavia, storks building their nests on the roofs
of houses in the country are welcomed as bringing
children for the household, and are cared for with a
credulity equalling pagan superstition.</p>

<p>The frog has sometimes found a place in Christian
symbolism as the most expressive image of the
resurrection of the body, because frogs, like the serpents
after their winter interment, emerge from their
hiding-places and renew their youth by casting their
slough.</p>

<p>Many farm and house companions figure in the series:
a dog, fidelity; a cock, vigilance; a turtle, always at
home; a snail, there is no hurry; a sheep, humility; a
lamb, innocence; a horse, patience and endurance; a
dove, harmless, the Holy Spirit; a lion, majesty and
force; a serpent, wisdom, and, with its tail in mouth,
eternity; a serpent was often represented on the stone
above the fireplace in Roman kitchens; a ram was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
significant of the Nundine sacrifices made weekly to
Jupiter; a lion and a goat driven by Cupid, the power
of love: he guides not only the lascivious, but the
strong.</p>

<h2 id="ANTIQUE_PASTES">ANTIQUE PASTES.</h2>

<p>The Antique Pastes are interesting from the fact
that they present us with many curious mythological
subjects not always to be found on semi-precious stones.
They are specimens of a branch of early Roman industry.</p>

<p>They were made in imitation of Oriental stones, of
which the supply was inadequate for the great demand
of the first and second centuries <small>A. D.</small>, and also as a
matter of economy. Often in ancient times a quantity
of fragments of hard semi-precious pebbles too small
to be engraved were pulverized, and the sand or granulated
mass was fused in crucibles just as glass is made.
This process enabled many lovers of the art to possess
examples in this cheaper artificial substance when the
same subjects on real India stones were commanding
exorbitant prices. Some of these gems are beautifully
opalescent and iridescent.</p>

<p>This iridescence, though so beautiful on the specimens
of that kind, is only owing to chemical action on the
paste gems during the centuries they have been buried
in the earth. Interesting intaglios and cameos in enamel
have withstood the wear of ages, and are in better
condition; the imitations of red jasper are wonderful.

<p>Many intaglios in antique paste are representations in
designs of ancient bronzes, of which we have no other
trace except their mention by early historians.</p>

<p>The most precious antique example in paste is the
Portland Vase. It was discovered in the sixteenth
century in a sarcophagus within the monument of the
Emperor Alexander Severus and his mother, Julia
Mamæa, on the Frascati road, about two miles and
a half from Rome. It was long known as the Barberini
Vase, having belonged to that family in Rome
for two hundred years; thence it came to England
in the last century, and after twice changing
ownership, at the death of the Duchess of Portland,
from whom it takes its name, it was sold to the Duke
of Marlborough, and is now in the British Museum. It
has been broken and mended. It is about ten inches
high, and at the broadest part six inches in diameter.
It was formed of paste, and afterward engraved.</p>

<p>The paste is in imitation of onyx, in two strata, white
upon blue, of an amethyst tinge; the figures are cut in
relief on the lighter color, the blue forming the second
plane or background.</p>

<p>Though the antique paste cameos and intaglios are
largely reproductions of subjects also found engraved
on pietradura, we are indebted to this class of gems
for many examples of ancient cameos and intaglios
which we would otherwise never have seen; in fact,
from the rare beauty of some specimens in paste, they
never could have existed in any other material.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span></p>

<p>Not only do both intaglios and cameos in antique
paste present us with the choicest examples of miniature
art, but the iridescence created on them by time
frequently renders them the most beautiful specimens
in a collection.</p>

<h2 id="MYTHOLOGICAL">MYTHOLOGICAL.</h2>

<p>Through the possession of these Pagan cameos and
intaglios we have become heirs to the most thorough
knowledge of Mythology.</p>

<p>Hundreds of distinct specimens may be gathered from
glyptic work centuries before Christ, and so arranged as
to form several genealogical trees.</p>

<p>In Mythology there is not one single ancestor of all,
as in the biblical history, where Adam is honored with
being our original and only progenitor and equally
censured with being the testator of our legacy of all
human ills. The myriad bigamist ancestors of the
countless mythological beings pictured on ancient gems
have created and bequeathed to us numerous families of
celestial and terrestrial divinities, denizens of earth, air,
and water, and hundreds of grotesque chimeras.</p>

<p>Like the royal families of our sphere, there was much
intermarriage of close relatives, many of their offspring
bearing at times the forms of animals, birds, and anon
reptiles. Some of their descendants were even metamorphosed
in those tropical climes into trees, under the
cooling umbrage of which other scions were born and
commenced their adventurous career.</p>

<p>These poetical conceptions were the mythological
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
forerunners of the simpler, purer, diviner religion which
was eventually given to man. A close observer may
find in these legendary myths antetypes of the omnipotent
Godhead now revealed to us and in which is
our sure hope and trust.</p>

<p>The Chinese are the only race producing glyptic
work in relief on hard Jade, and also on stones resembling
it&mdash;in which one is easily deceived.</p>

<p>They are said to be good copyists: all designs given
to them for reproduction are copied very closely, but in
what we find on engraved stones there is the type of
their nationality; it resembles nothing else. Their
work is mostly in very low relief, on Nacre, Jade,
Amethyst, and Agalmatolite.</p>

<p>Their pictured stones generally represent hideous
animals, birds, fruits, and views of paradise with figures
of grotesque divinities. Their inscriptions are not
deeply incised, but are usually letters or characters
in their language in relief.</p>

<p>The exquisitely beautiful details often exhibited by
the Chinese are surprising, especially when we consider
the hardness of the Jade, the material principally employed
by them.</p>

<p>What patience it must have required to cut those ornaments
in Jade which we find on their scepters and on
the handles of their official swords! Many pieces which
are shown in museums have cost years of laborious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
engraving. Jade has therefore been esteemed by the
Chinese as emblematic of all virtue.</p>

<p>In this connection it may be remarked that the
Burmese and the Siamese have seldom engraved on
any stones harder than Alabaster or Agalmatolite
(Chinese figure stone). Their subjects principally
represent Buddha; occasionally his two feet; their
emblematic flowers, and their deeply-revered sacred
Bôdhi-tree at Gaya.</p>

<h2 id="AZTEC_OR_MEXICAN">AZTEC OR MEXICAN.</h2>

<p>The American Continent has contributed some
unique work executed by the Aztecs anterior to the
Spanish conquest of Mexico.</p>

<p>Among the existing glyptic relics of nations we find
no examples of execution in stone-engraving more
peculiar than what has been preserved of the work of
the Aztecs or Mexicans, especially that done before the
occupation by Pizarro.</p>

<p>The character of their work is so crude and distinct
that no close observer can for a moment be mistaken in
detecting its origin.</p>

<p>I have met with Aztec engraved stones among
a miscellaneous collection offered to me for selection;
there was that quality which enables a connoisseur
to recognize the class of ornamentation
doubtless worn by that people whom Prescott represented
as decorated principally by gold, silver, and
feathers.</p>

<p>Large pieces, cameos of two and a half to three inches,
have been found which were worn by the Incas as breast
ornaments, and are always pierced, which shows that
they were suspended from the neck.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span></p>

<p>In fact, some of the most faithful representations of
costume, head-dress, and weapons are in <i>basso-rilievo</i>
engraved stones in opaque white Alabaster and pale-green
hard Nephrite.</p>

<h2 id="RETROSPECTIVE">RETROSPECTIVE.</h2>

<p>We have much to enjoy as we survey the gems of
the various epochs. The multifarious types that have
been gathered in forty centuries meet our view,
grouped in the tableau of engraved gems.</p>

<p>Our attention is drawn with interest to each sentiment
expressed, feature defined, or emotion portrayed.
We study the diversified qualities&mdash;the fineness or freedom
of touch, ingenious effects, delicate lines, choice
attitudes, graceful forms, force, spirit, and tenderness&mdash;which
characterize these monuments of patience.</p>

<p>The engraved gems rescued from the torrent, ebbing
and flowing with the fluctuating fortunes of ages, garnered
by successive generations, enrich the traditional
viaduct traversing the morass of many centuries. Some
blocks are less beautiful than others in the structure,
but from them we have founded our first footholds, and
from them we mount to the work that embellishes the
great Etruscan arches even when we revel on the
finely pencilled coping-stones of the Greek and Roman
epochs, or admire the ornate abutments of the Renaissance,
we should revert with pleasure to the earlier,
ruder contributions in the foundations, and we can
find pleasure in viewing and studying every part.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span></p>

<p>The builder’s stones are graven&mdash;the footway is of
pictured pebbles, miniatures, amulets, and seals, reflecting
lineaments and traces of the history of entombed
generations. Their inscriptions reveal to us the impress
of ancient, mediæval, and modern art.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
